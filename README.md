## WC Vendors 

http://www.WCVendors.com/

This is WCVendors, a fork of Matt Gates WordPress Product Vendor plugin.

This has been forked due to the original author abandoning support for the plugin. We aim to implement bug fixes, maintain backwards compatibility and introduce new features. 

Using the ever popular WooCommerce as the basis create your own market place to mimic the likes of envato, eBay, Amazon and more. Allow users to become vendors and create their own stores on your WooCommerce store.  

## WC Vendors Features

Allow vendors to sell just like etsy, Envato, or Amazon type sites! This allows other users to sell tangible products, virtual products, or downloads on your site. With this plugin, your vendors can receive commission of products they own from your store.

Vendors can view reports instantly to track how their sales are coming along. Optionally, vendors can filter reports to only view sales for one product, or multiple. Optionally, when a customer pays for a vendor’s product, the vendor can instantly receive the payment to their PayPal account, while the rest goes to the shop owner.

A comprehensive administration panel is available for the shop admin. Completely customize the vendors’ experience! You choose what they can and cannot see. You choose how vendors should get paid.

Vendors also have their own personalized dashboard they access from the frontend. Sales reports and settings for their shop can be accessed from the dashboard.

The checkout experience is just the same as you currently have it. This means that your customers still only have to pay once for however many products they purchase, regardless of which vendor is selling it.

Support is currently available for PayPal Adpative - parallel payments with chained payments planned. 

## Future Development

Features to be added include:

- Rating/feedback system for vendors
- Tracking Numbers for shipments
- Front-end vendor posting
- Better reporting
- Better shipping support
- Chained payment support
