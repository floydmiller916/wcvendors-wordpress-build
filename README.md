## WC Vendors 

http://www.WCVendors.com/

This is WC Vendors, a fork of Matt Gates Product Vendor plugin.

This has been forked due to the original author abondaning support for the plugin. We aim to implement bug fixes, maintain backwards compatibility and introduce much needed new features.

## WC Vendors Features

Allow vendors to sell just like etsy, Envato, or Amazon type sites! This allows other users to sell tangible products, virtual products, or downloads on your site. With this plugin, your vendors can receive commission of products they own from your store.

Vendors can view reports instantly to track how their sales are coming along. Optionally, vendors can filter reports to only view sales for one product, or multiple. Optionally, when a customer pays for a vendor’s product, the vendor can instantly receive the payment to their PayPal account, while the rest goes to the shop owner.

A comprehensive administration panel is available for the shop admin. Completely customize the vendors’ experience! You choose what they can and cannot see. You choose how vendors should get paid.

Vendors also have their own personalized dashboard they access from the frontend. Sales reports and settings for their shop can be accessed from the dashboard.

The checkout experience is just the same as you currently have it. This means that your customers still only have to pay once for however many products they purchase, regardless of which vendor is selling it.

## Future Development

Features to be added include:

- Rating/feedback system for vendors
- Tracking Numbers for shipments
- Front-end vendor posting
- Better reporting
