## WC Vendors 

This is WC Vendors, which is a fork of Matt Gates Product Vendor plugin. (http://shop.mgates.me/shop/wc-marketing/wc-product-vendor/)

This has been forked due to the original author abandoning support for the plugin. We aim to implement bug fixes, maintain backwards compatibility and introduce new features.
